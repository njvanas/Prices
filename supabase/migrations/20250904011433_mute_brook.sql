  # Add Sample Price History Data

  1. Purpose
     - Creates realistic price history data for existing products
     - Shows price fluctuations over the past 30 days
     - Enables price trend analysis and graphing

  2. Data Structure
     - Historical prices for each product across multiple retailers
     - Daily price variations showing market dynamics
     - Realistic price movements (increases, decreases, stability)

  3. Benefits
     - Enables price history graphs
     - Shows savings trends over time
     - Provides data for price alerts and notifications
